### Hi there üëã

I am Aadya, I'm majorly interested in Mathematical Applications of Programming. My tech stack majorly comprises of Python üêç, Cython, C (Basic), Numerical PyData Libraries (Numpy, SciPy, sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch and Many More ...). I was previously working at [Unify AI](https://unify.ai/) as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern on their Python Transpiler API. 


### Personal Projects

If you would like to check out my work, Please check the [chainopy](https://github.com/aadya940/chainopy) project. 
ChainoPy is a python package for Markov Chain Analysis and Markov Chain Neural Networks.

### Extra's

I've also served as a Peer Tutor in the course `Stochastic Processes`, tutoring students on topics like Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithms, Probability Theory etc.
I've also experimented with Various Deep Learning Models like U-Nets, U-Net++, Alexnet etc.
